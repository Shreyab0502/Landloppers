            <h3>Riga, Latvia</h3>
            <h5>November,25 2020</h5>
            <p class="blog-content-description">Riga is famous for its Old Town (Vecrīga) and city center (Centrs), in which over 800 buildings are of the Art Nouveau (aka Jugendstil) style of architecture. The old town of Riga is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Art Nouveau style involves intricate building facades, with carvings of flowers and mythological creatures, and ornate doorways and windows. Much of the old town was either destroyed by fire or destroyed by the Germans in World War II and remained in ruins until it was rebuilt after the World War II, and further refurbished since Latvia's accession to the EU, to delight of many visiting tourists.

                Riga is also popular due to its nightlife and discount airlines that offer cheap flights to/from much of Europe.</p>

            <h5>April,8 2021</h5>
            <p class="blog-content-description">Popularly referred to as the ‘mini Switzerland’ of Uttarakhand, Chopta (at an approximate altitude of 2,608 m) is a slice of paradise tucked away in the Garhwal Himalayas. Surrounded by bugyals or velvety meadows and pristine snow-capped peaks, Chopta is an all-year holiday destination: pleasant in summer, rain-fresh in monsoon and a snow-clad fairyland in winter. Chopta is at the epicentre of the Panch Kedar – the five most sacred Shiva temples in the state. On its left are located Kedarnath and Madmaheshwar shrines and on the right, Rudranath and Kalpeshwar, and just above it, the Tungnath temple.

      <h3>Edinburgh</h3>
      <h5>September,18 2016</h5>
      <p class="blog-content-description">One of Scotland's most attractive cities, the capital city of Edinburgh is also one of the UK's most visited destinations. Popular for its many well-preserved historic buildings, Edinburgh is perhaps best known as the home of the majestic Edinburgh Castle.

        Perched high above the old city on a rocky promontory, this 13th-century royal fortress includes highlights such as the famous One O'Clock Salute, held daily at Half Moon Battery, as well as the Scottish Crown Jewels in the Royal Palace. Also worth seeing are the Scottish National War Memorial and the famous Stone of Destiny (the Stone of Scone), only returned to Scotland after being held for 700 years in London.
        
        From the castle, it's easy to explore the other most important historic sites in the city, most notably the Old Town's Royal Mile with its fine architecture, boutique shops, cafés, restaurants, and art galleries. It's also where you'll find the splendid old Palace of Holyroodhouse.
